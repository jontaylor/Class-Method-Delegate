=head1 NAME

Class::Method::Delegate - Perl extension to help you add delegation to your classes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Class::Method::Delegate;
  use Package::To::Delegate::To;
  delegate methods => [ 'hello', 'goodbye' ], to => sub { Package::To::Delegate::To->new() };
  delegate methods => [ 'wave' ], to => sub { shift->{gestures} };
  delegate methods => [ 'walk', 'run' ], to => sub { self->{movements} ||= Package::To::Delegate::To->new() };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Creates methods on the current class which delegate to an object.

delegate takes a hash or hashref with the following keys.

methods

Takes an array ref of strings that represent the name of the method to be delegated.

to

a sub block that returns an object, which the method calls will be sent to.

=head2 Accessing the parent from inside the delegated class.

If the object you are delegating to has a method called delegated_by, then this will be called when delegating.
The $self of the package doing the delegating will be passed in, so you can then store it.

=head2 EXPORT
